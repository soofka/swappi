# swapp

### todo

- do i really always have to reprocess files that rely on other files?
- tester
- swappski elements as singletons?
- swappski->swappi?
- logfile handling to other operations
- process events and pass changed files from watcher to server - controversial for change event (changing file might impact many other files, not obvious relation between file changed and what to recompile), to be implemented for all others i guess?
- monorepo with swappi and swappi processors separately
- add processors:
  - ts
  - jsx
  - js bundler
  - css bundler
  - babel transpiler
