### todo

- write unit tests

- figure out image width vs pixel density
- service worker
- tester
- swappski elements as singletons?
- swappski->swappi?
- close server + watcher bug
- unhash index
- logfile handling to other operations
- process events and pass changed files from watcher to server - controversial for change event (changing file might impact many other files, not obvious relation between file changed and what to recompile), to be implemented for all others i guess?
