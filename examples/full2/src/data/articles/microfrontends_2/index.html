  In first part of this article I’ve answered two major questions related to
  microfrontend architecture — what is it and what is it for. From now on this
  article focuses on how is it done. This part in particular covers general
  overview of technical solutions that support microfrontends and explains how
  does it work from end user’s perspective.

  Let’s start with this diagram you’ve seen in part one, specifically with
  composition layer that is on top of it. In literature you’ll find it often
  referred to as Container Application. Its main purpose is to recognize which
  view is expected by the user, what elements is it built from, compose it from
  separate micro applications, and serve it. This task could be accomplished in
  variety of ways, each having its pros and cons.
</p>
<h3>Build-time integration</h3>
<p>
  In our transformation from monolith to microfrontends, initially we integrated
  them during build time. It means that all separate micro applications were
  downloaded and integrated into Container Application during its build process,
  and it was then deployed as a whole to each and every environment.
</p>
<p>
  In order to make it happen during first steps of the transformation, we went
  for the easiest solution we could imagine: we treated our monolith as
  Container Application and used NPM to do the job of downloading and
  integrating packages for us. We created a module named Node Package Provider,
  put package.json file in it, and listed all our microfrontends as
  dependencies.
</p>
<p>
  Then, we created a step in build plan of the monolith, in which program
  literally entered Node Package Provider directory and run npm install script
  in it. We published all separate applications to our local package repository
  and configured Node Package Provider so that it can access them. All packages
  were installed within this directory and were later injected on specific views
  with reference to it.
</p>
<p>
  This solution was cool, because it let us quickly move on to creating actual
  microfrontends instead of spending too much time on setting up some
  sophisticated integration processes. It had, however, some obvious issues, and
  was treated as temporary solution from the very beginning. Main pain point of
  this technique was that in order to update one of our microfrontends we had to
  publish new version, update reference in the monolith, and publish new version
  of the monolith.
</p>
<p>
  Other issues were related to versioning of these packages or the fact that
  they had to be prepared in specific way — in order to avoid installing their
  dependencies we were forced to keep them all as devDependencies, which was
  obscuring and inconvenient.
</p>
<p>
  Because of this, even though I keep referring to our applications created back
  then as “microfrontends”, they were not microfrontends by definition I
  provided at the beginning of this article — they were separate and
  independent, but not in terms of deployment. Their actual deployment was
  always directly related to deployment of the monolith.
</p>
<p>
  Generally speaking, if we go by definition of microfrontend as independently
  deployable piece of user interface (among other characteristics), build-time
  integration is not applicable. However, it is cool way to kick start this kind
  of transformation, focus on coding actual applications, and move them to
  run-time integration later.
</p>
<h3>Run-time integration</h3>
<p>
  Once all issues of build-time integration became too painful to ignore, we
  started moving towards run-time integration. In this approach our
  microfrontends were fully independent in deployment and downloaded to our
  user’s machine once he accessed certain view in which they were incorporated.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most commonly advised techniques to compose template on the server
  side would be using Server-Side Includes — feature that is available in
  majority of web servers. Here you can see basic example with pure HTML
  template and variable part that is going to be included by the server.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Header</h1>
    <!--# include file="$PAGE.html" -->
  </body>
</html>
</pre>
</partial>
<p>
  Here is Nginx server configuration ready to set that variable, populate the
  template, and serve it to the user.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
server {
  listen 8080;
  server_name localhost;

  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  index index.html;
  ssi on;

  rewrite ^/$ http://localhost:8080/page1 redirect;
  
  location /page1 { set $PAGE 'page1'; }
  location /page2 { set $PAGE 'page2'; }
  location /page3 { set $PAGE 'page3'; }
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  However, we’ve never used this technique, as it would require building new
  Container Application, and it was way too early for that. Instead, we still
  used monolith for this purpose, but we ditched Node Package Provider, deployed
  our microfrontends to separate Content Delivery Network, and linked them with
  monolith via simple URLs representing their actual locations. Thanks to this,
  we finally could replace a piece of user interface without need for deployment
  of monolith.
</p>
<p>
  This solution worked for us for quite some time, and still works in some parts
  of the application. It’s nice and simple, but doesn’t scale very well, and
  doesn’t help us get rid of monolith in any way. In order to do that,
  eventually we needed to build brand new Container Application.
</p>
<p>
  For that purpose, we went for heavily modified version of open source library
  Tailor created by Zalando. It lets us define all routes, templates, and
  fragments in simple and convenient configuration files, which we can split and
  maintain separately. We called it Templating Engine and established it as main
  entry point to our application for parts that are already migrated to this
  approach. Here’s how it works.
</p>
<partial
  name="img"
  src="templating-engine-with-user.png"
  alt="How Templating Engine handles user’s request"
  withCaption="true"
></partial>
<p>
  Whenever user enters our website, the request is passed to Templating Engine,
  which, based on request URL, recognizes which template is expected by the
  user, loads it, and then populates it with content of corresponding
  microfrontends.
</p>
<p>
  Here you can see example of route to template mapping. When our user goes to
  one of these URLs, Templating Engine will load corresponding template.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
routeMap:
  "/": "/index.html"
  "/thiscompany": "/companyHub/pages/thisCompany.html"
  "/jobs": "/companyHub/pages/jobs.html"
  "/contacts": "/companyHub/pages/contacts.html"
  "/reviews": "/companyHub/pages/reviews.html"
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Here is exemplary template. As you can see, most of the time it’s just
  collection of fragments, each representing separate microfrontend. Each
  fragment can have some configuration provided here, but most importantly — a
  unique ID.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
<fragment
  id="ch-background-image"
  slot="ch-background-image"
  timeout="30000"
  async
></fragment>
<fragment
  id="ch-meta-data-header"
  slot="ch-header"
  timeout="30000"
  async
></fragment>
<fragment
  id="ch-jobs"
  slot="ch-block-main"
  timeout="30000"
></fragment>
<fragment
  id="ch-assets"
  slot="ch-block-end"
  timeout="30000"
  async
></fragment>
</pre>
</partial>
<p>
  Finally, there is a map of fragment IDs to their actual locations. When
  certain template is loaded, Templating Engine loads each microfrontend from
  its location, and replaces corresponding fragments with them.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
fragments:
  ch-assets: http://localhost:8080/assetslinks

  ch-background-image: http://localhost:8080/v1/background
    /companyId/{companyId}/lang/{langName}/?{additionalParams}

  ch-jobs: http://localhost:8080/v1/jobs/companyId/{companyId}
    /lang/{langName}/?{additionalParams}

  ch-meta-data-header: http://localhost:8080/v1/header
    /companyId/{companyId}/lang/{langName}/?{additionalParams}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  We’ve created this tool also due to the fact that in reality there are other,
  common tasks that could be taken care of on this level instead of delegating
  them to each separate micro application. List of such tasks include, but is
  not limited to attaching common, shared libraries to each page, collecting and
  sending basic tracking data related to specific route taken by the user, or
  passing around information about A/B tests that user is in.
</p>
<p>
  Beneath Templating Engine, we have separate microfrontends, which, besides
  being loaded and displayed, sometimes also need to communicate with one
  another. This need can be satisfied in variety of ways.
</p>
<h3>Communication between microfrontends with publisher and subscriber</h3>
<p>
  For example, we are currently using simple JavaScript library named PubSubJS,
  which implements well-known pattern of “publisher and subscriber”. In this
  example of implementation, you can see that we import this library along with
  list of messages from our repository of packages. Then there is React
  component, which represents login modal for our users. Once it is mounted on
  the page, it subscribes for specific message, and will behave in certain way
  whenever such message is published.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
import {
  PubSub,
  CANDIDATE_PROFILE_EVENTS,
} from '@stepstone/pub-sub';

class LoginModal extends React.Component {
  public componentDidMount() {
    PubSub.subscribe(
      CANDIDATE_PROFILE_EVENTS.SHOW_LOGIN_MODAL,
      (msg, data) => { /* ... */ }
    );
  }
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Here, on the other hand, is example of message publication. Whenever such line
  of code is invoked by one of our microfrontends, if login modal is present on
  the same page, it will be triggered and displayed.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
PubSub.publish('CANDIDATE_PROFILE_SHOW_LOGIN_MODAL');
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  As a matter of fact, you can type this exact line of code in JavaScript
  console while you’re on one of our homepages, for example stepstone.de. Due to
  the fact that this API is exposed globally in window object, you’ll see this
  behavior in action. This, in turn, can come handy for example for testing
  purposes.
</p>
<p>
  Truth is that separate library for “publisher and subscriber” is not needed
  anymore, given current state of commonly available APIs in our browsers. This
  exact pattern is utilized in JavaScript for years now — common events, such as
  click or hover, work exactly the same way, they’re just named differently:
  there are elements that listen for the event instead of subscribing for
  messages, and there are elements that dispatch events instead of publishing
  messages.
</p>
<p>
  Having access to powerful API named CustomEvent, which is now supported in all
  major browsers, one can recreate the same communication method without need
  for PubSubJS or any other library, like in this example.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
element.addEventListener(
  'myEvent',
  (msg, data) => { /* ... */ }
);

element.dispatchEvent(
  new CustomEvent('myEvent')
);
</pre
  >
</partial>
<h3>Communication between microfrontends with shared state</h3>
<p>
  Another idea to enable interactions between separate microfrontends within one
  view would be to use some shared, global state, possibly implemented with the
  help of some library, such as Redux. Some of our applications use Redux
  anyway, and some that don’t usually are simple enough to have no need for
  communication with others, so it wouldn’t be much of an overkill.
</p>
<p>
  Having one, shared state per view comes with some very handy features — for
  example, applications can use it not only for communication purposes, but also
  to store shared data instead of each one having its own copies inside, which
  is quite common , especially when it comes to the most basic entities, such as
  user ID. Such state could be put in local storage on user’s computer when he
  leaves our page, and taken from there when he comes back, so that he has the
  application in exactly the same shape as he left it. Add some service workers
  on top of it and you’re only one step away from having your application being
  fully functional even when user is offline.
</p>
<partial
  name="img"
  src="microfrontend-app-with-global-state-local-storage-and-service-worker.png"
  alt="Microfrontend app with global state, local storage and service worker"
  withCaption="true"
></partial>
<p>
  That sounds awesome to us, but it’s still purely theoretical argument — we’ve
  not tested this approach in any way yet. We’re pondering with this idea,
  because added value could be massive, but it’s always a trade-off. Simple
  implementation like PubSubJS we’re using comes with minimal amount of code
  shared across teams and very little need for maintenance, while global, shared
  state based on some specific technology would come with much more extensive
  implications for present and future development.
</p>
<p>
  Why Redux, though? After all, they say that you can replace it entirely with
  React Hooks and Context API. Well, it might be true within single React
  application, but given the fact that our views are composed from several
  separate applications of such kind, we have not found a way to make them use
  one state given those tools (although it seems to be possible to accomplish
  with an addition of ReactN library). Redux, on the other hand, is not coupled
  with React by definition, can be instantiated separately, and easily provided
  to all React apps within same page.

  This article is published in installments, and here’s where second one of them
  ends. In the next part you’ll read about the way we’re creating
  microfrontends, tools and processes that help us take control over such
  distributed system.
