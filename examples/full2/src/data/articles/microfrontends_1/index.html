  In StepStone Services we’re working on maintenance and development of big,
  complex job board platform, among other things. This project was initially
  conforming to monolithic architecture and stayed this way for many years.
  However, in order to fight certain issues caused by such approach,
  service-oriented architecture on backend side and microfrontend architecture
  on frontend side were employed. In this article I describe our way of doing
  microfrontends, things we’ve learned from it so far, and tools and techniques
  that help us create and maintain this sophisticated software architecture.
</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  I joined StepStone Services four years ago as a software engineer in order to
  work on maintenance and development of our core product — online job board.
  You know, this kind of website, where user can search for interesting job
  offers based on some criteria, browse them, read them, apply for them if he
  wishes, and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  Project turned out to be a little bit more complex than I expected — both in
  terms of business logic and number of functionalities, as well as in terms of
  technical solution and architecture. Basically, it was one big repository with
  a few millions lines of code, written without too much attention paid to code
  separation, modularity, or readability.
</p>
<p>
  I bet you know this story — either from your own experience, or from plenty of
  similar cases described all over the Internet. When I joined this project, the
  power of spaghetti was already strong in it. We only made it stronger, adding
  more and more layers of macaroni on top. With time it became harder and harder
  to add a feature without producing a bug, releases took more and more time,
  platform became less and less stable, and eventually we got stuck.
</p>
<p>
  Back then it took us one whole week to put new version of our application from
  developers’ computers to our end users — we had one release per week. Nowadays
  we can put pretty much any piece of business logic or user interface from
  developers’ computers to production in less than 30 minutes, of course not
  omitting any of standard release process steps, such as integration or
  end-to-end testing. We managed to do this with — as a matter of fact still
  ongoing — transformation from monolithic to service-oriented architecture, but
  it wouldn’t be possible to do it fully without extending this idea to frontend
  development. And that’s what this article is about — extending idea of
  service-oriented architecture to frontend development — an approach often
  named “microfrontends”.
</p>
<p>
  In this article I’ll walk you through this topic step by step, one problem at
  the time. I’ll start with defining terms “microfrontend” and “microfrontend
  architecture”, explain what’s the idea behind, and discuss pros and cons of
  the approach. Then, I’ll move on to more technical part, where I’ll show you
  how does it work in real life, how do we do it in my project, what are main
  pain points and how do we tackle them in our daily work.

<p>
  You might have heard this term “microfrontend” already — despite it being
  first used back in 2015, especially in 2019 it became yet another, trending IT
  buzzword on the Internet. It’s popular enough to attract attention of the most
  prominent of our fellow programmers, one of them being Dan Abramov, who
  tweeted in May of 2019 that he doesn’t understand the concept. This tweet
  sparked long and exhausting discussion on Twitter as well as served as a
  reference for plenty of articles, blog posts, vlog videos, or conference
  talks. Not surprisingly — discussion it originally prompted was very fierce,
  plenty of well-known experts voiced their opinions, and many important issues
  were raised and talked through.

<p>
  I too will refer to this Twitter thread here and there in this article, as I
  want to address some of the issues that were pointed there. Let’s start with
  the first one — what is a microfrontend and what is all the fuss about?
</p>
<p>
  As I mentioned, idea of microfrontends is direct extension of idea of
  service-oriented architecture to frontend development. Therefore, analogically
  to service or microservice, microfrontend is small, logically separated part
  of your application, or more precisely, in the context of frontend
  development, part of user interface of your application. Part, which first and
  foremost is independent from the rest of your system in terms of its
  deployment. Additionally, microfrontend should encapsulate some piece of
  business logic of your application and should be solely owned by a team that
  is responsible for this part of your application end to end.
</p>
<p>
  Microfrontend architecture would be then an architectural style where
  independently deliverable frontend applications — microfrontends — are
  composed and served to the end user as one, complete, coherent application.
</p>
<partial

<p>
  Application created with microfrontends approach to the end user may look like
  regular website, while under the hood it may be built as a composition of
  separate micro applications. Each of those applications has its own codebase
  and code repository, its own pipeline to push this code through from
  environment to environment, its own version on each of those environments at
  any given point in time, and its own team responsible for this area end to
  end.
</p>
<partial
  name="img"
  src="microfrontend-app-in-development.png"
  alt="Microfrontend app in development"
  withCaption="true"
></partial>
<p>
  The idea of code separation of this kind is nothing new — only in relation to
  frontend web development there were similar approaches described in the past,
  such as “vertically decomposed applications”, “self-contained systems” or
  “microservice websites” — but with rise of service-oriented architecture and
  microservices in last years, this approach, this time referred to as
  “microfrontends”, is getting a lot of traction and is being widely adapted.
  You can find plenty of talks and articles from past year or two coming from
  such companies like Microsoft, Spotify, or Zalando, where they describe their
  experiences with development of their products with this architecture.
</p>
<p>
  If they are doing it, they are doing it not without a reason. But what might
  be the reason, then? Well, I can’t speak for them, but I can and will tell you
  why do we in StepStone do microfrontends.
</p>
<h3>Why do we do microfrontends?</h3>
<partial
  name="img"
  src="dan-abramov-on-reasons-behind-microfrontends.png"
  alt="Dan Abramov's follow-up tweet on micro-frontends"
  withCaption="true"
></partial>
<p>
  Coming back to Dan Abramov’s tweets, he suggested that problems solved by this
  approach should already be solved by something simpler, such as good component
  model, hence it must be about something else. Maybe solving organizational
  issues? I partially agree with that. In our experience it does not necessarily
  solve any issues of this kind, but requires specific setup on organizational
  level by design, which you might find beneficial.
</p>
<p>
  Let me show you what I mean. Assume an application, which consists of
  independent storages dedicated for backend services, which are then connected
  to their own frontend services, and then there is this thin composition layer
  on top of everything. This is how architecture of application I am working on
  looks like, of course represented in very, very simplified way. Once we put it
  in the context of our organization and add teams to this diagram, some of the
  benefits of this approach become very clear.
</p>
<partial
  name="img"
  src="microfrontend-app-architecture-with-teams.png"
  alt="Microfrontend app architecture with teams"
  withCaption="true"
></partial>
<p>
  As you can see, given such separation of code, separate areas can be owned end
  to end by separate teams. This means that you can have small, autonomous
  teams, which are heavily focused on customer. Almost every member of every
  team has some impact on actual end users and can observe it. This naturally
  increased dedication, commitment, satisfaction of those team members.
</p>
<p>
  It also enables teams to work on greatly reduced scope. You see, in case of
  our application, business domain became simply too big for one person to know
  it all. Hence, we split it into narrow, logically separated areas — subdomains
  — and assigned them to separate teams to own them end to end. Now developers
  in each of those teams can actually become experts on their part of the
  domain. Having deep understanding of business-related and technical aspects of
  their area translates to much better quality of the code produced and
  solutions designed by such team.
</p>
<p>
  Both these benefits combined with main assumption of this architecture — that
  you can deploy small parts of your application to live quickly and harmlessly
  — directly impact speed and agility of your development. Imagine you have
  small, focused team, full of experts on what they’re doing, that can ship
  stuff to production in half an hour. Such environment encourages small
  changes, often iterations, experiments — basically everything that is
  encapsulated in term “agile software development”. That’s what we want — to be
  agile — so that’s what we do.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, having your application logically separated by design, you can
  minimize risk that comes with inevitable replacing its parts with entirely new
  ones — you know all dependencies beforehand instead of discovering them during
  development. Thanks to this, we can gracefully, progressively refactor our
  application part by part, wherever and whenever it makes the most sense.
</p>
<p>
  I want you to keep in mind a few things, while I’m bragging about all these
  pros. First thing is the fact that architecture is a tool. Tool, that is
  designed to address and fix efficiently some certain, specific issues. This
  tool works for us, because it addresses issues we have — it is not meant to be
  used by everyone, everywhere.
</p>
<p>
  As a matter of fact, it’s rather common recommendation to start with monolith
  instead. Monolith is good, solid, most importantly simple architecture
  pattern, that just does the job. Truth is, most of the applications that are
  created today will never grow in size to the extent where they’ll need such
  scaling by decomposition.
</p>
<p>
  When it comes to microfrontend architecture in particular, probably the most
  common issue that people point out is potential, harming fragmentation of
  development processes, technologies, solutions, and eventually of the
  application itself. The risk is that dramatic increase in teams’ autonomy will
  lead to decrease in effectiveness and lack of consistency of the application.
</p>
<p>
  The risk is valid, if you ask me — we’ve experienced this issue ourselves, on
  plenty of different occasions. However, I find teams being autonomous and
  fully responsible for themselves to be a good thing — and our developers tend
  to confirm that this model works for them. There are ways to mitigate this
  risk, mainly standardization and automation of variety of steps in software
  development processes, that will be discussed later in this article.
  Basically, it’s about finding good balance between said autonomy of teams and
  common standards shared across them.
</p>
<p>
  It’s also important to take into account balanced, sensible size of each
  microfontend. Contrary to some beliefs, which in my opinion make this risk of
  fragmentation slightly exaggerated, not every single piece of user interface
  has to be separate entity. Naturally, the more fragmented your application is,
  the more threatening risk that comes with such fragmentation becomes, but
  microfrontends approach can be applied with different levels of fragmentation,
  which is another way to manage this potential liability.
</p>
<h3>How micro is microfrontend?</h3>
<p>
  In short, microfrontend should be as small as it makes sense. As with
  service-oriented architecture, also microfrontends come with clear trade-offs.
  Smaller entities are easier and faster in deployment, but slicing one entity
  into several ones means need for more deployment processes, automation,
  integration, and also more dependencies between them. One big entity is easier
  to maintain as a whole, but comes with the cost of lack of separation — it may
  become less readable, take longer to test and deploy, or combine different
  logical areas in itself, leading to lack of clear ownership.
</p>
<p>
  In our system, we have microfrontends that greatly vary in size. Most of them
  are small, single widgets — tens of which would be combined into one view —
  but there are also plenty of examples of microfrontends that represent whole
  pages or even collections of pages that are logically related to each other.
</p>
<p>
  When we decide upon size of microfontend, we take several factors into
  account.
</p>
<h4>Reusability</h4>
<p>
  First question to ask would be: “does this element is meant to be reused on
  different, separated views?”. If yes, it’s not worth to duplicate its code in
  all these places. Instead, it should become separate entity with single source
  of truth and integrated into those views separately.
</p>
<p>
  However, it’s quite common that it’s not exactly the same microfontend across
  different views, but rather some kind of variation about it. In such case we
  make decision based on amount and severity of those differences. For small
  differences between variants we keep them as one and make varying elements
  configurable. The more configuration is needed, the more different variants
  are, and the more likely it is that they should be separate microfrontends
  instead.
</p>
<p>
  It’s also important in this case to consider context in which this part is
  going to be used by others. Main question is if you, as an owner of such
  element, want to provide single source of truth about it — then you’re in full
  control of which of its versions is used by all consumers, but you’re
  responsible for making it work for all of them — or you want to give others a
  choice — then you pass this responsibility to them, but you can’t control
  which version they use and can’t make them migrate to the newest one whenever
  you find it ready.
</p>
<h4>Ownership</h4>
<p>
  Another reason to create separate microfrontend would be based on answer to
  the question: “does this element extend across different logical areas owned
  by separate teams?”. If yes, it breaks the rule of single, clear ownership,
  therefore should be split into smaller elements, each assigned to specific
  teams responsible for corresponding area.
</p>
<p>
  It is important for each microfrontend to be owned by single team which is
  keen on logical area related to this microfrontend. However, with time, we
  often add more and more functionalities to our widgets and applications, and
  sometimes they end up combining features from different areas. Once we realize
  that given element includes business logic that should be some other team’s
  responsibility, it becomes good candidate for slicing.
</p>
<p>
  It’s rarely slice in half, though. More often than not it’s rather
  hierarchical relationship: we take part encapsulating such feature and make it
  separate microfrontend providing this functionality, pass ownership to other
  team and put it within their space, then refer to it from main applications,
  which becomes kind of consumer.
</p>
<p>
  Usually we are aware of this kind of situation before this code is shipped to
  production — to realize that you’re developing outside of your area of
  expertise doesn’t require any magic. Hence, we try to do it the right way from
  the beginning, which means requesting such functionality from team responsible
  for area that it’s related to. However, it might not be possible to obtain it
  in reasonable time — after all, they might be busy doing other stuff.
</p>
<p>
  Then we can implement it for them, as good as our limited knowledge allows us,
  and put it directly in their infrastructure by creating pull request. It still
  requires some work from them — to review it and to propose improvements, most
  likely more than few, since we’re developing in their area and attempt to
  conform to their standards — work, for which we also would have to wait
  sometimes unacceptable amount of time.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, such candidates for split are being created, and we’re perfectly
  fine with them, as long as they are marked as technical debt, which we
  transparently plan to pay off in foreseeable future.
</p>
<h4>Sheer size</h4>
<p>
  Last but not least, there are candidates to break down into smaller entities
  due to their sheer size: “does this element start displaying problems similar
  to those that monolith applications have?”. If yes, that’s yet another reason
  to consider splitting into separate entities.
</p>
<p>
  Some of our applications don’t have any elements that will be reused and fit
  perfectly into single team’s responsibility, yet we break them down into
  smaller ones due to the fact that their development and maintenance start
  becoming an issue. It’s entirely subjective metric, based on developer’s gut
  feeling and some statistics, most often related to scaling or releasing of
  this piece of software.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, if we plan to scale certain part of microfrontend differently
  than the rest — for example, one part of the application will be accessed in
  run-time by 1 user per minute, and other by 1000 users per minute — it’s best
  if those parts are separated. If releasing becomes problematic, takes a lot of
  time, results in some bugs and generally becomes unreliable — it’s also best
  to split this element into smaller ones, although in such case it’s less
  obvious where to draw lines.
</p>
<h4>In practice</h4>
<p>
  Good example of highly fragmented parts of the application would be homepage
  or dashboards of some kind — they often combine elements that are also visible
  on other pages.
</p>
<p>
  Example of simple single page application would be, in our case, user’s
  profile edition page. It’s one page with multiple editable sections, where
  user can provide different kinds of information related to his education and
  professional career. It’s one whole app, none of its parts is used on any
  other view, fits into single team’s responsibility, and we don’t observe any
  issues caused by its size.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, there are single page applications which encapsulate plenty of pages
  — such as editor of job offers, with which recruiters can conveniently set up
  all kinds of content that are later browsed by job seekers. This application
  is much more sophisticated than user’s profile edition page, as there are much
  more kinds of information to provide. It comes with plenty different pages and
  its own routing. Still, in our architecture it is one microfrontend — not
  reused in other parts of the system, owned by one team, released as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, none of those examples is bound to stay in such shape in future —
  their size is based on their business requirements and whatever we find
  working for us in development and maintenance at the moment. Requirements will
  change, environment will change, our preferences will change, so setup of
  particular microfrontends will change too. We need to take into account all we
  know when we start, and employ the simplest possible solution. Therefore, as
  with architecture of whole application, also with specific microfrontends we
  usually start with small monoliths, unless we know beforehand, that there are
  requirements for reusability, cross-team features, or other contraindications.
</p>
<p>
  All in all, there is no golden rule when it comes to size of microfrontend,
  and don’t trust anyone telling you that more “micro” or more “macro” frontends
  are better. Trust yourself and your judgement. Weigh pros and cons and decide
  upon slicing given part of your application into smaller ones whenever you
  find it beneficial to you.

  using in order to make this whole architecture work.
