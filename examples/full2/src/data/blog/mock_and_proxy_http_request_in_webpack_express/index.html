  Back in the day, my JS projects were small and self-contained. Nowadays, in my
  professional work, majority, if not all of front-end applications I am working
  on are connected to multiple back-end services for variety of reasons. It
  gives me a freedom of not caring of the back-end, as long as we have defined a
  contract, and proceeding happily with what actually matters, i.e. colors and
  animations. But it also gave ma some headache, when I wanted to have pleasant,
  convenient coding environment on my localhost, and not have all of these weird
  back-end stuff running on my local machine as well. Here's how I worked it out
  with both Webpack Dev Server and Express.
</p>
<p>
  I've found two ways of dealing with HTTP requests coming out of my front-end,
  so that I can handle them freely, without major changes to development version
  of my application: mocking and proxying. Both are based on intercepting these
  requests on my localhost level, and handling them manually. However, they are
  handled differently, and they have their own pros, cons, and ideal case, in
  which you want to use them.
</p>
<p>
  There is some code in this post, displaying how you can mock or proxy this
  problem out of your way. There is also some more code on this subject on my
  github, in code examples section of my blog repository. You'll find a small
  setup there, which showcases all ideas I'm bragging about in this post. There
  is an application with a button, that sends HTTP request with fetch; local
  server, that you can proxy your requests to; and four examples, each
  demonstrating different solution to this problem. Check it out!
</p>
<h3>Mocking</h3>
<p>
  With mocked HTTP request response, you don't even call any back-end at all.
  Request is intercepted, and mocked - manually defined by you - response is
  served by your localhost. It's useful for most cases, because it gets the job
  done easily. It's particularly useful, when your back-end is just slow, or
  there is a lot of data to transfer, or a lot of calls - you just don't
  transfer any data over the wire, and there is no delay in your development.
  Downside of this solution is that you never see actual response that is coming
  from the service. You may end up surprised by totally different data model
  provided by back-end, or by any other difference between your assumption
  stated in your mock and actual response.
</p>
<h4>Webpack Dev Server</h4>
<p>
  proxy is an option in configuration of Webpack Dev Server, which allows you to
  define proxy for any HTTP request that comes out of your localhost. You can
  also define specific bypass in it, with conditions as detailed as you want. In
  my example, I'm intercepting all calls to /api URL, and respond with mocked JS
  object instead.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
devServer: {
  // ...
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      bypass: (request, response) => {
        if (request.url.substr(-4) === '/api') {
          response.send({ data: 'mocked data from webpack.devserver.mock.config.js' })
        }
      },
    },
  },
},
</pre
  >
</partial>
<h4>Express</h4>
<p>
  Contrary to Webpeck Dev Server, mocking a response in Express doesn't feel
  like hacking. It's very straightforward, almost like this framework was
  created specifically to perform tasks like this (?!).
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
const app = express();

// ...

app.get('/api', (request, response) => {
  response.json({ data: 'mocked data from express.mock.js' });
});
</pre
  >
</partial>
<h3>Proxying</h3>
<p>
  With proxied HTTP request, you call actual back-end service. Request is only
  proxied - redirected to it's true destination, and potentially modified a bit.
  It's usually preferred for when you are fine with getting real data from real
  service, even at a cost of waiting some additional time with each visit to
  your localhost, but your back-end is on different host than your local, which
  is usually the case. Cons? If you can afford it time- and resources-wise,
  there are none, in my experience.
</p>
<h4>Webpack Dev Server</h4>
<p>
  Proxy with Webpack Dev Server can be achieved using proxy configuration
  option, this time more like it was originally intended. target parameter
  describes destination to which certain call should be redirected. If
  pathRewrite parameter is not provided, /api will be concatenated with the
  target, which is not what I wanted to achieve here (hence I've defined this
  parameter), but you may find it useful.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
devServer: {
  // ...
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:3001/get-secret-data',
      pathRewrite: { '^/api': '' },
    },
  },
},
</pre
  >
</partial>
<h4>Express</h4>
<p>
  In Express, it's a little bit more effort, since it's required to incorporate
  http-proxy package for this operation. Similarly to Webpack Dev Server, target
  parameter defines destination of your redirection. The other parameter,
  ignorePath, is set to false by default. If you don't override it, /api will be
  added to the end of your request's URL. Again, it might be what you want in
  some cases.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
const app = express();
const apiProxy = httpProxy.createProxyServer();

// ...

app.get('/api', (request, response) => {
  apiProxy.web(request, response, {
    target: 'http://localhost:3001/get-secret-data',
    ignorePath: true,
  });
});
</pre
