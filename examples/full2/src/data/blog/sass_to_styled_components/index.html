  Who doesn't like to constantly rework perfectly fine stuff into something new
  and fancy just because it's trendy now? Well, probably pretty much every
  single JS developer, most certainly everyone who works with this language long
  enough to experience at least a glimpse of famous "JS fatigue" feeling (so
  approximately a few weeks). However, I created this blog as a playground to
  try out new libraries and frameworks, and since I'm learning Styled Components
  for my professional work at the moment, even though Sass-based styling worked
  perfectly for my needs, I reimplemented all of it into this controversial
  CSS-in-JS. And I'm still sane!
</p>
<p>
  Styled Components is one of many implementations of an idea of CSS-in-JS:
  concept, where you don't artificially map styling of components to components
  themselves, instead you treat both as one, and put it all in your JS/TS file.
  It's currently a hot topic in JavaScript world, at least for a year already.
  There are many advocates for this approach, many opponents, and probably twice
  as many libraries that bring it to life. Styled Components, with almost 20k
  stars on GitHub at the time of writing this post, must be one of the most
  widely used. It's popularity has been one of major reasons behind selecting it
  in our front-end development in StepStone.
</p>
<p>
  After a few days of learning and coding, I must admit, I see some profits
  coming out of it (don't mistake it with strong recommendation or even opinion;
  I don't have one yet), outside of tight coupling components with their styles,
  which makes a lot of sense to me, especially in the context of React, and
  being up to date with fancy trends around the world. It forced me to rethink
  not only actual CSS code I have, but also separation of components inside my
  application: I created a few new components along the way, thus now I have
  smaller, more specialized, cleaner entities here and there, and I consider it
  a gain.
</p>
<p>
  As usual, I implemented it within React and TypeScript project - this blog,
  the one you're reading. I'll display examples taken out of it's flesh, and you
  can always refer to more detailed implementation on my GitHub, where this
  application resides on average day.
</p>
<p>Without further ado, let's dive straight into code samples.</p>
<h3>Rewriting variables into theme</h3>
<p>
  I started with reading the documentation. Once I got a grasp of it, I
  proceeded to installation of the package.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
npm install --save-dev styled-components
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  Foundation of my Sass-based styling of this blog was file named
  variables.scss, where I stored standardized sizes of all elements, colors,
  spacings, fonts, etc. Naturally, I started with implementation of something
  analogical in Styled Components. In there, it's called theme, and it has it's
  own section in documentation.
</p>
<p>Originally, my variables.scss file was:</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
$mobileBreakPointWidth: 968px;

$infoSectionWidth: 32%;
$contentSectionWidth: 100% - $infoSectionWidth;

$blue: rgb(0, 1, 49);
$darkBlue: darken($blue, 10%);
$darkerBlue: darken($blue, 20%);
$lightBlue: lighten($blue, 10%);
$lighterBlue: lighten($blue, 20%);

$white: rgb(246, 246, 246);
$darkWhite: darken($white, 10%);
$darkerWhite: darken($white, 20%);

$black: rgb(20, 20, 20);
$lightBlack: lighten($black, 10%);
$lighterBlack: lighten($black, 20%);

$gray: rgb(144, 144, 144);

$baseDistance: 8px;

$marginXXS: 0.25 * $baseDistance;
// ...

$paddingXXS: 0.25 * $baseDistance;
// ...

$fontSizeS: 1.5 * $baseDistance;
// ...
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  When I attempted to redo it as a theme, which is basically JavaScript object,
  I stumbled upon first issue: I couldn't perform basic mathematical operations
  on percents and pixels, as I could in Sass. Instead of having base distance
  defined as 8 pixels and multiplying it by any number without care, I had to
  define value of base distance as 8 outside of my theme, perform any
  calculation on pure number, and add px to the result. Template literals came
  to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
  Another issue I discovered was using some of Sass native functions, such as
  lighten or darken. They're not supported in Styled Components by default.
  There are some additional packages, mainly Polished, prepared by authors of
  Styled Components themselves, which provide such functionality. However, at
  this point I had my first reflection on styling of my blog. Why do I even
  bother with this kind of operation for just a couple of variables? I decided
  that instead of that, I'd rather have all my colors defined explicitly.
</p>
<p>Finally, my theme.ts ended up looking like this:</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
const infoSectionWidthPercentageValue = 32;
const baseDistanceValue = 8;
const baseFontSizeValue = 18;
const baseLineHeightValue = 24;

export const theme = {
  mobileBreakPointWidth: '968px',

  infoSectionWidth: `${infoSectionWidthPercentageValue}%`,
  contentSectionWidth: `${100 - infoSectionWidthPercentageValue}%`,

  blue: 'rgb(0,1,49)',
  darkBlue: 'rgb(0,0,24)',
  darkerBlue: 'rgb(0,0,0)',
  lightBlue: 'rgb(0,2,98)',
  lighterBlue: 'rgb(0,3,147)',

  white: 'rgb(246,246,246)',
  darkWhite: 'rgb(222,222,222)',
  darkerWhite: 'rgb(198,198,198)',

  black: 'rgb(20,20,20)',
  lightBlack: 'rgb(32,32,32)',
  lighterBlack: 'rgb(44,44,44)',

  gray: 'rgb(144,144,144)',

  baseDistance: `${baseDistanceValue}`,

  marginXXS: `${0.25 * baseDistanceValue}px`,
  // ...

  paddingXXS: `${0.25 * baseDistanceValue}px`,
  // ...

  baseFontSize: `${baseFontSizeValue}px`,
  baseLineHeight: `${baseLineHeightValue}px`,

  fontSizeS: '0.7em',
  // ...
};
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  You might have noticed another difference between the two: in Sass I used
  pixels as my font sizes, now I decided to go for "ems". That's another side
  effect of my reconsideration of my whole stylesheet. Since I couldn't just go
  for math operation on any unit like a mad man, I stopped for a second and
  thought again about this, read some articles and guidelines, and ended up
  deciding in favor of scalable unit.
</p>
<h3>Styling components</h3>
<p>
  Having my variables redefined as Styled Components theme, I could proceed to
  getting rid of all SCSS files, replacing them with TS files. Hence, I asked
  myself a question: how do I provide my new variables to my new styles? Again
  documentation about theming came handy - theme is provided through component's
  props. I only had to wrap my root component in ThemeProvider, coming from
  Styled Components.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
import theme from 'common/theme';

// ...

const Blog = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      // ...
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
</pre>
</partial>
<p>
  Thanks to this solution, I could now not only use variables, but also access
  all the other props in my styles. Not that I've used this feature, but I
  realize, that it opens another dimension of possibilities in their
  customization.
</p>
<p>
  Before modifications, style for one of my components - Quote, piece of text
  visible on left hand side of the screen in desktop view - looked like this:
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
@import 'components/Blog/variables.scss';

.quote {
  margin: $marginM;
  padding: $paddingS;
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: center;
}

@media (max-width: $mobileBreakPointWidth) {
  .quote {
    display: none;
  }
}
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>After addition of Styled Components, analogical file's content was:</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
import styledComponents from 'styled-components';

export const StyledQuote = styledComponents.p`
  margin: ${props => props.theme.marginM};
  padding: ${props => props.theme.paddingS};
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: center;

  @media (max-width: ${props => props.theme.mobileBreakPointWidth}) {
    display: none;
  }
`;
</pre
  >
</partial>
<p>
  As you can see, I could pretty much copy-paste my whole original style into
  template literal, which, decorated by function from Styled Components, became
  actual styled component. There's also type of component specified in there -
  it's a paragraph.
</p>
<p>Now, instead of using traditional HTML notation in my rendering function:</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
import './styles.scss';

export const Quote = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <p className="quote">
      <Label name="quote"/>
    </p>
  );
};
</pre>
</partial>
<p>I used component generated by Styled Components:</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
import { StyledQuote } from './styled';

export const Quote = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <StyledQuote>
      <Label name="quote"/>
    </StyledQuote>
  );
};
</pre>
</partial>
<p>Voila!</p>
<p>
  However, not always it was such a piece of cake. In some cases, in my SCSS
  files I had nested selectors, with styling for specific child elements. At
  first I was fighting it, I tried to somehow preserve this configuration. I
  figured, that I still can define such class-based selectors within my Styled
  Components, and attempted to go with it. I quickly realized that I don't like
  it - I had components wrapped in nice Styled Component decorator, without any
  class definition, inside which there were divs with specific classes... This
  combination looked just wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Then I understood, that my separation of components is straight up wrong in
  those cases. If there was a component that rendered specific divs with
  different, explicit styling... Why those divs are not independent components?
  So I made them independent components, I got rid of this styling issue, and I
  ended up with much cleaner code in some areas. That's, by the way, what I
  consider the greatest improvement to my blog's code base that came out of this
  whole Styled Components experiment.
</p>
<p>
  Once I was done with it, I could see my blog in almost the same shape as it
  was originally, styled by Sass (only difference being sizes of fonts here and
  there, which was due to change from pixels to "ems", and was expected).
  Finally, I could remove all SCSS files, and all CSS and SCSS loaders both from
  my Webpack configuration and from my dependencies.
</p>
<h3>Code quality</h3>
<p>
  Nevertheless of this change, I didn't want to make it at the cost of
  consistency of my code. Previously, I used StyleLint to ensure that all my
  SCSS files conform to the same standard. I was thinking if I can get the same
  cool feature for Styled Components, and I was happy to discover, that it comes
  almost out of the box. There is a package that integrates StyleLint with
  Styled Components, so that linting styles worked for me exactly the same as
  before: stylelint-processor-styled-components. It's not a part of main Styled
  Components package, but it's created by the same contributors, and hosted from
  the same account on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
  At this point I was able to ensure quality of my styling code at the same
  level as before the change to Styled Components, but I was very happy to
  discover, that I can go even further than that. All thanks to
  jest-styled-components package, which is also created by the same group of
  people responsible for Styled Components.
</p>
<p>
  I already had Jest snapshot tests written for all my components, in order to
  ensure consistency and control over tree of DOM elements rendered by them. Why
  wouldn't I have similar snapshot dedicated for styling generated for such
  component? I never thought about it before, but now that I unearthed it, I
  immediately wanted to have it. It's simple to generate, check, and modify
  during development, and also very beneficial. So I went for it.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I didn't manage to successfully run setup presented in the
  documentation of this library, where they simply import it into their test
  files, and obtain styling of the component in their snapshot. I spent some
  time researching it and concluded that it might be caused by Enzyme or
  TypeScript, which I'm using. Not discouraged, I simply created separate tests
  to check my styles.
</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
import * as React from 'react';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';
import 'jest-styled-components';

import theme from 'common/theme';
import { StyledQuote } from 'components/Quote/styled';

describe('<StyledQuote/>', () => {

  it('is styled correctly', () => {
    expect(shallow(<StyledQuote theme={theme} />)).toMatchSnapshot();
  });

});
</pre>
</partial>
<p>Running test displayed above resulted in following snapshot:</p>
<partial name="code">
  <pre>
exports[` is styled correctly 1`] = `
.c0 {
  margin: 16px;
  padding: 8px;
  font-style: italic;
  text-align: center;
}

@media (max-width:968px) {
  .c0 {
    display: none;
  }
}

<p
  className="c0"
/>
`;
</pre>
</partial>
<p>
  This way, I not only completely reimplemented Sass-based styling with Styled
  Components for my whole project, but also improved it by adding some extra
  snapshot tests, covering styling of my components - area, which was not tested
  at all prior to this experiment. I learned something new, my blog got some
  bonus points for being trendy, and in the process, quite unexpectedly, I must
  admit, it also became tested more thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
  That was a good exercise. I learned a lot, and I hope you can take something
  out of it too.
</p>
