  When building web applications in React, I usually choose Express to be my
  server, and more often than not I use React-Router to manage redirections and
  changes in history. Not without a reason - both are among the most popular
  choices in their respective fields nowadays; both are simple and elegant in
  every day work. However, I had some tough moments with both of them when it
  came up to setting all unrecognized routing to "Not Found" page, and this
  piece came as a result of them.
</p>
<p>
  My goal was to have Not Found page as part of my Single Page Application, not
  some separate and entirely different piece of code, which I can't reliably
  control, and which may stand out noticeably from my sleek user interface. It
  required me to shift most of the decision making process when it comes to
  routing from my back-end to my front-end. Therefore, I came to realization,
  that I will now use Express to serve static content only, and this is common
  and well documented use case. Quickly I came up with simple configuration,
  that always serves static index.html file.

  <pre>
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../dist/index.html')));

app.use((request, response) => {
  fs.readFile(indexPath, (error, file) => {
    if (error) {
      response.status(404).send(error.toString());
    } else {
      response.status(200).send(file.toString());
    }
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
</pre

  Then, I moved to React-Router. Basic component of this library is Route, with
  property path, which describes chunk of URL, corresponding to the view to be
  displayed. React-Router documentation states, that "Routes without a path
  always match", and that was exactly what I needed. Having Route without path,
  pointing to Not Found view, I only needed to redirect some other routes to
  meaningful views that I had consciously created, and everything else is
  covered.
</p>
<p>
  However, in React-Router, Routes on their own render when they match URL
  inclusively. Not Found view stated as a Route without path would render
  unconditionally and irrespectively of the URL. Switch, also coming from
  React-Router, solved me this issue. In Switch, routes render when they match
  the URL exclusively, which means that always up to one Route will be rendered,
  and always it will be the first one that matches the URL. I put my Not Found
  Route at the end of Switch, and I was good to leave the office. Job well done.

import * as React from 'react';

import Home from 'components/Home';
import About from 'components/About';
import NotFound from 'components/NotFound';

  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route exact={true} path="/" component={Home}/>
      <Route path="/about" component={About}/>
      <Route component={NotFound} />
    </Switch>
  );
};

export default App;
</pre>
